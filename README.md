#Close Approach Data
 
The following table shows close approaches to the Earth by near-Earth objects (NEOs) limited as selected in the “Table Settings” below. 
Data are not available prior to 1900 A.D nor after 2200 A.D. Data are further limited to encounters with reasonably low uncertainty

LD-	Lunar distance (LD or ? ? L     {\textstyle \Delta _{\oplus L}}  {\textstyle \Delta _{\oplus L}}), also called Earth–Moon distance, 
	Earth–Moon characteristic distance, or distance to the Moon, is a unit of measure in astronomy. It is the average distance from the center 
	of Earth to the center of the Moon. More technically, it is the mean semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit. It may also refer to the 
	time-averaged distance between the centers of the Earth and the Moon, or less commonly, the instantaneous Earth–Moon distance. 
	The lunar distance is approximately a quarter of a million miles (400000 km).
